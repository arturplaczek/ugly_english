App layers

## Continuous Integration 🤖

App Layers comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests 🧪

For first time users, install the [very_good_cli][very_good_cli_link]:

```sh
dart pub global activate very_good_cli
```

To run all unit tests:

```sh
very_good test --coverage
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
